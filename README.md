# MSCS532_Assignment6
Assignment 6 of MSCS 532 course

## Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures
This assignment explores the implementation and performance analysis of Deterministic and Randomized Selection Algorithm. The aim is to analyze the performance of selection algorithms along with some elementary data structures.

## Files
- 'elementary_data_structures.py' : Python implementation of Elementary Data Structures such as array, stacks, queues and linked list.
- 'median_of_medians.py' : Python implementation of Deterministic Selection Algorithm (Median of Medians).
- 'randomized_quickselect.py' : Python implementation of Randomized Selection Algorithm (Randomized Quickselect).
- 'Assignment6_Report.pdf' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, and comparisons between deterministic and randomized selection algorithm as well as different types of elementary data structures.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/sdumaru/MSCS532_Assignment6.git
2. Make sure python is already installed in your system, otherwise download and install python.
3. Navigate to the repository directory: cd MSCS532_Assignment6
4. Run the code using the command: python .\elementary_data_structures.py or
python .\median_of_medians.py or python .\randomized_quickselect.py

## Summary
This assignment involved implementing selection algorithms and basic data structures to analyze their performance. Deterministic and randomized selection algorithms were tested for efficiency, while arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists were evaluated for different operations. The results showed that arrays are efficient for access, while linked lists excel at deletions, and stacks and queues are consistent for constant-time updates.
